## 📌 Project Summary

This project explores the relationship between child care subsidies and poverty reduction in Oakland, California. By analyzing the CalWORKs Stage 1, 2, and 3 programs and their implementation through local agencies (Hively, BANANAS, 4Cs), this work identifies systemic barriers, funding gaps, and policy misalignments that put families at risk of falling back into poverty.

The findings support the need for extended support timelines, inter-agency coordination, and expanded access to family-based care.
